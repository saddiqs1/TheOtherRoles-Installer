# The-Other-Roles Installer for Windows

Simple installer that creates a backup folder for among us, and downloads the latest release of [`The Other Roles`](https://github.com/TheOtherRolesAU/TheOtherRoles) into it. Creates a desktop shortcut that can be used to launch the modded version of the game.
